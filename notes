module not found error for ipynb files

1. "%pip freeze" in a python cell to check the installed libraries using this code in a notebook cell


some rows have werid values, latitude=999,999
g 1974 01 13 09 09 30    318           0     0     0     0 999999 999999 999999 999999 999999

should I include hour, minute, second?



# row[1] = year
# row[2] = month
# row[3] = day
# row[4] = hour
# row[5] = minute
# row[6] = second
# row[7] = sunspot group number
# row[12] = sunspot latitude

g 1974 02 18 14 20 30    347          21   160    21   160 -16.03 204.95  61.11 255.49 0.8711


MAIN IDEA: how does sunspot type affect behavior

specola graph does not have info on area, so no area/density graph can be made with it 

things i can graph?

1. density or area of different sunspot types
2. track the path of sunspot types, have the graph show gradient lines to show the general direction 
   of where sunspots move
3. why are there no F types at solar minimum?
4. how does lifespan relate to location/latitude


what i can analyze so far
- types E and F dont appear within 5 degrees latitude of equator
